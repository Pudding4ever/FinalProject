Vestibular Appritus
	+ Three channels in the ear cannal that allow for balance and 
	+ motion sensing. Pretty much the ADI for the human body.
	+ Disfunction in this area will cause sever loss of balance and
	+ can also effect hearing and sometimes speech

	"Vestubular Appritus is pretty much the ADI humans"

	= Damage to the Vestibular Appritus may be cause by the drug
	= gentramicin

Sensory Cortex
	+ Used to feel and process what is going on on the skin
	+ located at the top of the head

	"The King can sense all from the Crown :)"

Visual Cortex
	+ Located at the back of the head near the occipital lobe

	"Think of a camera and go to the back"

Dr Wilder Penfield
	+ Found "maps" that show brain activity of functions over
	+ specific parts of the brain

2 Nerveous Systems
	Central: Brain and spinal cord responsible for proccessing infomation
	Peripheral: Brings messages from sensory reciptors in the body to the spinal cord

Axion:Carry electrical impulses 2-200 mph
Cell Body: Sustains cells life
Dentries: Recive input from other neurons through excitation stimuli or inibition stimuli.
the space between the dentries where it recives input is called a synapse.

Three nerves in the hand
	+	Radial Nerve
	+ 	Ulnar Nerve
	+ 	Median Nerve

Audiotory and specific visuals must be made in the quest to kill dyslexia.

Nucleus Basalis
	- Makes the brain plastic and helps in the soildification of these plastic
	- changes. This is done by the production of a chemical called BDNF

BDNF (Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor)
	1) Considilates the connections between the neurons. "Ties them dentries together"
	2) Promotes the growth of fat around every neuron. "Insulation for axions son"
	3) Brain map differentiation. "Sort 'em functions out"
	4) Closes down the critical learning period. "Shut it down"


Addictive drugs will produce a protein called Delta FosB (^FosB)
each time the drug is used it accumulates in the neurons which eventually
throw a genetic switch which does irreversible damage to the brains 
dopamine system and renders it far more prone to addiction.

Kinase A: protine that when build up in the cell switches on
a gene that allows the cell current nerve endings to grown and 
branch out which helps in the development of long term memory 
1300 to 2700 synaptic connections.

OCD is produced by three major parts of the brain

	+ Oribital frontal cortex. (Detects mistakes)
	+ Cingulate Gyurs. (Triggers feelings of anxiety about percived mistake)
	+ Caudate Nucleus. (Allows us to move on. Allows our thoughts to flow from
	one to the next)

4 Types of Plasticity

	1) Map Expansion: ouccors in the boundaries between brain areas
	2) Sensory Reassingment: which occurs when one sense is blocked 
	so other sensory inputs feed it information
	3) Compensatory Masquerade: Allows for other parts of the brain
	to take over processing input.
	4) Mirror Region Takeover: When another hemisphere is picking up
	the slack
